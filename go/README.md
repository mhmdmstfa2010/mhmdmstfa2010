# Geofinder

An online game that's like _Where's Waldo?_ but for houses

## Description

_Geofinder_ is an online scavenger hunt game. Its gameplay is simple: Given a photo of a house somewhere in the world, your task is to look for that house inside a marked area on a map. While that may sound straighforward, how you will go about looking might not be.

_Geofinder_ comes in two modes.

1. In the Wordle-like **default mode**, you are given one house a day and have until the end of the day (CST time) to find it.
2. In the Netflix-like **challenge mode**, aka Geo50x, you are given 50 houses at once.

_Geofinder_ is inspired by such childhood games as _[Where's Waldo?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where%27s_Wally%3F)_ and _[Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Sandiego)_. And the simple pleasures of looking out through vehicle windows and just gazing at the passing landscapes and cityscapes.
